This is a simple kth-order Markov generator. It is not implemented as efficiently as it could be, and it does not (yet) separate by sentences.

The executable expects two things:
  1) A number of words you want it to produce.
  2) A starting sentence to seed it with.

If your sentence is of k words, you will create a kth order Markov generator.

The executable will then read all input from stdin as its training material.

For instance,

  ./Markov 100 We the People < constitution.txt
